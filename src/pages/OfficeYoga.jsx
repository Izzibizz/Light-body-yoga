My office yoga sessions are designed to fit seamlessly into the workday, offering a mix of gentle movement, mindful breathing, and relaxation techniques that help reset the body and mind. Sessions can be done in a conference room, a gym or whichever space you have to roll out your yoga mats. 
Each class is tailormade for your needs and requests, but could typically include:</p><ul>
<li>🌿 Gentle stretches to release tension from sitting</li>
<li>🌬 Breathing exercises to improve focus and energy</li>
<li>💆‍♀️ Simple positions that support better posture and mobility</li>
<li>🧘‍♂️ A short relaxation to leave everyone feeling refreshed</li>
<li>✨ The opportunity to connect with collegues in a fun and genuine way</li>
</ul>
<p>
The practice is accessible to all levels <br/>
The duration can be anything between 30 to 60 minutes, whatever fits your office. Usually no shower is needed.
