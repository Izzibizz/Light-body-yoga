            My treatments are a blend of bodywork and energy healing, designed
            to support both physical and emotional well-being. Each session is
            shaped by the needs of the moment—whether that means releasing
            deep-seated tension, restoring balance, or simply creating space to
            slow down and reconnect.

              🌿Swedish massage uses gentle, flowing strokes to ease muscle
              tension, improve circulation, and bring a deep sense of
              relaxation. It’s a grounding, nurturing practice that helps the
              body unwind at its own pace.

              🌬 Reiki is a quiet, meditative practice where hands are placed
              lightly on or near the body, guiding energy to where it’s needed.
              It can bring a sense of clarity, balance, and emotional release,
              often leaving a feeling of deep calm.

              💆‍♀️ Healing sessions draw from different techniques, combining
              energy work, breath, and intuitive touch to create a session that
              meets you where you are. Each treatment is unique, offering a
              space to restore both body and mind.

            There’s no right or wrong way to experience these treatments—just an
            opportunity to pause, listen inward, and allow yourself to fully
            relax.
