              Hi I’m Therese! My journey to yoga, and back to embodying my
              healer’s soul in this lifetime, has been a winding, rocky and
              beautiful road that’s carried me across the world—a path of
              movement, creativity, and deep healing, paved with self-discovery
              and growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              I began my path in 2002 at the Ballet Academy in Stockholm, where
              I trained to become a dancer. For years, I worked as a dancer and
              musical theatre artist, expressing my soul and inner core through
              the language of my body—a passion that still defines me. My
              favorite quote is by Isadora Duncan, “You were once wild here.
              Don’t let them tame you,” and I carry that untamed spirit into
              everything I do.
            </p>
            <p>
              Back in 2013 my life took me to New York, where I lived for five
              years, studying acting and discovering yoga—a turning point that
              reshaped my world. I pursued 300 hours of yoga teacher training in
              Costa Rica and 200 more in Bali, immersing myself in the practice,
              philosophy, and tools of yoga. Later I deepened my teacher
              training in Yin yoga here in Stockholm, my base since 5 years
              back. Through meditation and these teachings, I found profound
              healing, and they now form the foundation of my life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, I’m dedicated to helping others tap into their inner
              strength through yoga. With a heart full of light and love, I
              share dynamic, playful classes infused with themes and intentions
              to cultivate energy and mindfulness. My creativity flows into
              every session, reflecting my dancer’s soul. Beyond teaching yoga,
              I offer healing through reiki and massage, guiding others toward
              authenticity and compassion—for themselves, towards others, and
              how we show up for Mother Earth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yoga, to me, is more than a practice; it’s a way to unlock
              insights, heal, and become more observant and empathic. My mission
              is to inspire that journey in others, drawing from my lifelong
              love of movement and the wisdom I’ve gained along the way. Whether
              in the studio or beyond, I’m here to share the transformative
              power of yoga with you.
